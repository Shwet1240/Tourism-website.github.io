  India as a tourist destination
  
  India with a land mass of about 3.3 million sq. Kms. and a population of over 1.1 billion is the 7th largest and the 2nd most populous country in the world.
  
  The people of India are known for their traditions of hospitality to foreigners. They have varied life styles, cultural heritage and colourful fairs and festivals which make India a unique tourist destination.
  
  India is also a country of diverse tourist attractions. It offers enormous diversity in topography, natural resources and climate. It is also a fascinating kaleidoscope of races, languages, religions, customs and traditions. India is thus a tourist destination for all travellers in all seasons.
  
  India abounds in attractive and well-preserved historical sites, ancient monuments of architectural grandeur and not-so-ancient mosques/durgahs, churches and places of worship of other diverse faiths.
  
  Taj Mahal at Agra with a romantic story behind it is known the world over for its treasure of architecture. Besides Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Sikandra, Rambagh and the Imperial ruins of the Mughal city at Fatehpur Sikri are some of the finest examples of architecture combining both Hindu and Muslim elements.
